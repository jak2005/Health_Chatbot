The provided healthcare information doesn't directly address back pain, but I can offer some general guidance. \n\nBack pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle strain, poor posture, or an underlying medical condition. If you've recently experienced an injury at work, you may be eligible for Worker's Compensation to cover the costs of your care. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances of your injury.\n\nIf you're concerned about the cost of seeking medical attention for your back pain, it's worth noting that some hospitals and healthcare providers offer uncompensated care for those who are unable to pay. However, this is not a substitute for proper health insurance, and you should explore all available options for coverage.\n\nTo get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for your back pain, I recommend scheduling an appointment with a healthcare professional. They can assess your condition and provide personalized advice. If you're having trouble communicating with your healthcare provider due to a hearing or speech impairment, you may want to look into using a TTY (teletypewriter) or other assistive communication device.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm an AI and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
